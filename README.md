Synergizing Optical Character Recognition: A Comparative Analysis and Integration of Tesseract, Keras, Paddle, and Azure OCR
This study presents an extensive comparative evaluation of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) performance across various image pre-processing techniques such as Edge Detection and Image threshold, and various datasets including the IAM dataset and FUNSD dataset, to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of each OCR engine under different circumstances such as recognizing different hand-writings and extracting key information from complex layout forms under poor image resolution.
The OCR engines presented in the study include Tesseract OCR, Keras OCR, Paddle OCR, and Microsoft Azure Computer Vision. An innovative design and implementation of an integrated OCR Scoring System which, intricately assesses each engine’s output, integrating confidence scores and Character Error Rates (CER) to determine the most accurate text extraction, is developed and evaluated.
The selection of evaluation metrics—accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error Rate (WER), and running time per image (RT)—was strategic to distinguish the performance of individual OCR engines comprehensively. Precision and recall offer insights into an OCR engine’s inclusivity versus its focus on detail, which bears significance in handling complex data sets. Running time was tracked to evaluate processing speed, providing a pragmatic lens for understanding the trade-offs between speed and accuracy in real-world applications. demonstrate that while individual OCR engines have their strengths, the integrated
Our findings reveal that the Integrated Method, which amalgamates the strengths of individual OCR engines, consistently outperforms its constituent systems across all tested conditions. It demonstrates remarkable adaptability and resilience, achieving superior accuracy, precision, and recall rates, particularly in the face of the image quality fluctuations inherent in real-world tasks. Azure OCR emerged as a significant contributor to this integrated success, showing exceptional processing speed and precision, with notable proficiency in deciphering complex handwriting—a capability that suggests a high degree of immunity to image quality variations.
